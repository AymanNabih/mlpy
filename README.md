# Particle Swarm Optimization Framework

## Used for research on:
> Investigating Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimisation for Neural
Network Training

# ToDo:
1. Read through research again to see how the chaotic data is integrated into the PSO.
2. Decide on data sets to test against.
3. Should we maybe try replicate his results before we progress further.
