## Particle Swarm Optimization and Neural Network Framework:
### Investigating Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimisation for Neural Network Training

*Abstract:* Historically, particle swarm optimisation algorithms have successfully been applied to neural network training, often outperforming traditional gradient-based approaches. Studies have however shown that particle swarm optimisation algorithms do not scale very well, performing poorly on high dimensional neural network architectures. This study aims to research the effect of using a chaotic particle swarm optimisation algorithm for neural network training. The resulting neural networkâ€™s saturation and overfitting, as well as high-dimensional performance, will be investigated. 

Hi Michal

Thanks for getting back to me.

I just wondering how you integrated the chatic data into the PSO. 

Anna has pointed to me to this github repo https://github.com/wikkiw/chaotic_generators.git (Im not sure if this is yours or not)
I see in that the data is stored in an array and I assume that the data is pulled from this array for r1 and r2, is this correct?

Another question I have is weather each particle has its own generated map or weather they share the map over the all the particles.

I appoligise if some of these questions seem irrelevent but I don't feel like I can reference your CPSO without implementing it in the same way.
